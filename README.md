# Token-weighted Backlogs

Tokenlog is a governance tool to create token-weighted backlogs

It allows projects to continuously gather feedback from their token holders in order to help plan and prioritize their work.â€‹ It allows token holders to actively signal which items matter to them rather than just vote on single proposals.

> A better way for projects to collaborate with their biggest supporters.

## Summary 
Tokenlog works on any Github repository and leaves your current workflow in place. Voting is either by a 1-token, 1-vote, or as by default through quadratic voting. Quadratic voting is a collective decision-making procedure where individuals allocate votes to express the degree of their preferences, rather than just the direction of their preferences.

## Documentation
Tokenlog works on any Github repository and follows Github's relative paths, e.g. `tokenlog.xyz/<org>/<repo>`. To allow voting, see the following Config section. 

## Config
Tokenlog tries to pull a configuration directly from your repository. This proofs ownership of the repo and doesn't require any curation or management. Just upload a `tokenlog.json` config to the root of your repository.

Example
```
{
    "org": "wslyvh",
    "repo": "tokenlog",
    "tokenAddress": "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f",
    "labels": ["enhancement"]
}
```

- `tokenAddress` is the token that people are allowed to vote with
- `labels` is an optional list of Github labels that allows you to filter onwhich issues token holders can vote on
